# 🚀 Supervised Learning Playground  

Welcome to my **Supervised Learning Proof-of-Work Repository** 🎯  

This repo is my personal **learning lab** where I explore, implement, and push everything I practice under supervised learning.  
Every algorithm here might have **multiple projects/implementations**, because I believe in experimenting with the same concept in different ways — that’s how real learning sticks.

## 📌 What’s This Repo About?  

- A place where I dump everything I do while learning **supervised ML algorithms**  
- Not just a single “clean” implementation — but **multiple projects per algorithm** (different datasets, problem statements, approaches)  
- A **public proof-of-work** showing my progress in ML step by step  
- Something I can revisit later for **quick revision**  
- A repo that anyone following a similar journey can use as a **learning reference**

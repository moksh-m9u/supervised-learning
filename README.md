# 🚀 Supervised Learning Playground  

Welcome to my **Supervised Learning Proof-of-Work Repository** 🎯  

This repo is my personal **learning lab** where I explore, implement, and push everything I practice under supervised learning.  
Every algorithm here might have **multiple projects/implementations**, because I believe in experimenting with the same concept in different ways — that’s how real learning sticks.

## 📌 What’s This Repo About?  

- A place where I dump everything I do while learning **supervised ML algorithms**  
- Not just a single “clean” implementation — but **multiple projects per algorithm** (different datasets, problem statements, approaches)  
- A **public proof-of-work** showing my progress in ML step by step  
- Something I can revisit later for **quick revision**  
- A repo that anyone following a similar journey can use as a **learning reference**  

---


Each algorithm will have:  
- **Multiple projects** (each with its own notebook or script)  
- A **mini README.md** inside the folder that documents intuition, math, and a summary of all projects  

---

## ✨ Why This Repo Exists?  

- To **make my commits meaningful** instead of dumping random files  
- To create a **personal archive of projects** that I can quickly refer back to  
- To show **consistency** on GitHub (learning in public)  
- To encourage juniors & peers that learning ML can be done **step by step with proof**

## 🤝 Other Collab Repo  

I will be also actively contributing to a similar repo maintained by my friend **Piyush Gupta**.  
That repository is more **documentation-heavy** and structured as a reference for juniors.  
This one, on the other hand, is more of my **experimental workspace + project hub**.

## ⚡ How You Can Use This  

- Browse through the algorithms & projects  
- Use them as **reference implementations**  
- Fork & adapt them to your own datasets  
- Check the docs repo (by me & Piyush) for a more **structured learning path**
